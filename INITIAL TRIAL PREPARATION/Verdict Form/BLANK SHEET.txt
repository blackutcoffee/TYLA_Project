The defendant's lawyer in a civil case has the option of making 
	a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that 
	his or her client's liability has not been proven by a 
	preponderance of the evidence.


The judge will either grant or deny the motion: 
	If it is granted, the case is over and the defendant wins. 
	If the motion is denied, as it usually is, 
		the defense is given the opportunity to present its evidence.


 In a civil suit, the jury will find for the plaintiff or the defendant. 
	If the jury finds for the plaintiff, it will also usually 
		set out the amount the defendant should pay the plaintiff for damages, 
		often after a separate hearing concerning damages. 
	The jury will also make a decision on any counterclaims that may be part of the case.
