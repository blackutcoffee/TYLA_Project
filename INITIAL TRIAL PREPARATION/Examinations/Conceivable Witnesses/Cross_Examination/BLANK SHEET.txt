*Only ask leading questions, not open-ended questions. The question should be
worded so that the only possible answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno.‚Äù


Eliciting Witness Cross Examination Responses:
1) Facts that help prove your theory
2) Facts that paint your client in a good light
3) Facts that show why the witness (or another witness from the other side) is not credible
4) When crossing experts, you can include facts indicating:
	a. Lack of qualifications
	b. Unreliability of methods used
	c. Insufficiency of evidence / lack of investigating important areas
	d. Limitations of experts‚Äô conclusions
5) Always think big picture and think about your theory. You do not want to waste time
asking questions on areas that do not matter very much to proving your case.
