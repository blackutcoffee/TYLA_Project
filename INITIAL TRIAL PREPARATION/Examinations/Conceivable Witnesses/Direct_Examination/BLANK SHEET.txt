1) Facts that establish the credibility/qualifications of the witness
2) Background/foundational facts that show how your witness knows what he/she knows
3) Facts that help demonstrate your theory and theme of the case. Focus on what really
matters. You do not have to address every possible point that might help your side.

4) Harmful facts that will be brought out in cross examination by the opposing side (gives
you the first chance to address it before the other side harps on it)
5) For expert witnesses, see the foundation that must be established under Federal Rule of
Evidence 702.
6) Typically organized chronologically for non-expert witnesses.
7) For experts, typical organization is: 
	(1) Qualifications/background; 
	(2) How got involved
with case, what evidence examined; 
	(3) What methods used; 
	(4) What opinions reached;
	(5) Explanation of each opinion (often with a visual aid of some kind).
