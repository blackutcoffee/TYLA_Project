Résumé-(3Pages)

-Tom Clark Literature,  
“roSENcrANTz ANd GUILdENSTErN ArE dEAd” IS an astounding, intellectually challenging, and humorous concoction. Stoppard
cleverly captures the characters of Hamlet, written by Shakespeare, but
creates somewhat of a comic tragedy. Clearly an oxymoron, but profoundly effective. The play focuses on the story of Hamlet, but from the
viewpoint of rosencrantz and guildenstern, and it also takes the theories proposed in Hamlet and presents them in a comic, rather than sullen, manner.
